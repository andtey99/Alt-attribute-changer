## About script
This is IIFE script that, after being entered into the console, automatically changes the "alt" attribute of all pictures to random ones and adds a green frame to these pictures.
The script receives random names from the site via an asynchronous request.
The script supports additional image loading.
Also, when you click on the picture, you can change the attribute yourself

html file allows you test the script, but you can use the script on google images and other websites that have img
